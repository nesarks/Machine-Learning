## A convolutional neuralnetwork for American gang sign langage.

## Contains a database of 6 classes of 6 different hand signs used by gang members.

This project mainly focuses on classifying the gang signs. I have implemented a simple CNN model to classify them.
Since i didn't have enough data in the dataset the model might be overfitting. I'm also planning on training a transfer learning model using VGG16 model to overcome the ovefitting problem.
